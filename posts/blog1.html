<h2>Stay safe, everyone! <code>(03/12/2020)</code></h2>
By now, you have probably heard of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yes, it's a pandemic, and here are things you should remember:
<h3>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</h3>
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

<h3>Practice respiratory hygiene</h3>
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

<h3>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early</h3>
Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

<p>Please stay safe, everyone!</p>
