<h2> Meet my family! <code>(03/16/2020)</code> </h2>
<p>For Filipinos like me, <font color="midnightblue">family is everything</font>. Families are centers of happiness and serve as shelter when things are tough and you've had enough. Sisters and brothers are always there to help you, and parents will always guide you along the way.</p>
<p>I really love my family. My mother had always been there for me, and my father supports my education. I think.</p>
<p>My grandparents and my cousins were really kind to me and I loved hanging out with them often.</p>
<p>I know we're facing times of dread since the coronavirus problem is arising, so no matter what, stay safe and take care of your families. Love, trust, and cherish your loved ones as you go further your life.</p>
<p>And also, always pray to God if you're facing problems. He will always be there for you.</p>
<p>That's it, have a nice day!</p>
